# Object
* Ultrasonic sensors detect the distance from the pet, and the feeder starts working when the pet approaches.
* The weight sensor detects the weight of the food in the bowl. When the weight of food < 10g, starts the motor to make the baffle turn to replenish food. When the weight of food > 50g, the motor rotates backward.

* Limiting conditions:  
   1.There will be a 4h cooldown time after feeding is first turned on.  
   2.The machine can only add the food for three times within 24 hours.
